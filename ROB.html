            <h2>WHAT IS ROBLOX ?</h2>
            <p>
Roblox is a massively multiplayer online game creation platform and game distribution platform that allows users to create their own games and play games created by others. It's characterized by its user-generated content, where players can design, develop, and share their own games using Roblox Studio, a proprietary game development environment. The platform features a wide variety of games spanning various genres, from role-playing games and simulations to obstacle courses and competitive shooters. Roblox utilizes its own scripting language, Lua, for game development. The platform is known for its large and diverse community, its accessibility, and its ability to foster creativity and collaboration among its users. It's available on a wide range of devices including PCs, mobile phones, and game consoles. Roblox is free to play, with in-app purchases available for virtual currency (Robux) that can be used to purchase virtual items and experiences within the games.
